# Project Brief: `Wetribe: Connect people interested in making the world better` (BACKEND)

Wetribe is a mobile friendly web app that connect people interested in taking actions to make their environment a better place.


### Motivations + Problems

*Why is this project useful? Why were you interested in working on it? What hair-on-fire problems do you see?*

I got the Idea of Wetribe based in my own experiences travelling and seeing the impact that our lifestyle makes in our environment.

The problem with polution, poverty and inequity is so big that normally we feel that it is impossible to make a change. This project is based in the idea of strength through unity, and that if we work toguether we can contribute to a better world.

The App base the content in Geolocation, making easy to create a community or find groups of people wherever you are. The idea is to find relevant events as quick as possible, join and start doing.



### Key Features and Technical Implementation Plan


* Geolocation. It is important to find communities relevant to the user location so they can take an action. Also when the user creates a community they can set the location of the event with the help of Google Places Autocomplete making it accurate.
    * Use of Google Map Api for searching events
    * Use of React Places Autocomplete to accurately set the address of the events preventing from misstyping.
    * Use of Map to make easy and clear finding events.

* Mobile Friendly.
  * Use of Bootstrap 4 to make it responsive in all kind of screens

* Filtering / Searching
    * React + API hooks for filtering/searching a list of events by categories, date and location. 

* Comments. Supporting the idea of community.
